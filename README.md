# flightStats
This is a first start in Shiny.
The app compares the information of flight purchases such as the month in which it was bought, the date of travel, price, and destination. Flights are from Berlin to other european airports.

The data set is not a real one, but programatically generated.

Future improvements can include:

* Choose better colors, separating categorical from interval values
* Prediction of prices
* Improve reactivity in the map
